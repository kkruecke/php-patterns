PHP behaves differently than a language like C++. You will not get a error on a method like test() shown below

    class Base {}
    
    class Derived implements Base {
     public function whoami() { echo "I am derived\n"; }
    }
    
    function test(Base $b)
    {
      $b->whoami(); 
    }

provided you pass it a class derived from Base that has a whoami() method. You will get an runtime error if you pass it a Base instance. In C++, you could never
write such code. For example,

    #include <iostream>
    using namespace std;
    
    class Base {};
    
    class Derived1 : public Base {
    public:
     void  whoami() { cout << "I am Derived1\n"; }
    };
    
    class Derived2 : public Base {
    public:
     void whoami() { cout <<  "I am Derived2\n"; }
    };
    
    /* This will not even compile */
    void  test(Base& b)
    {
       b.whoami();
    }
    
``test(Base&)`` will only compile if Base has the whoami() method.
